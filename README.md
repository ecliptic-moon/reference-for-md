## Headings, sub-headings and sub-sub-headings
The `#` symbol creates a larger heading to work with, this could be used for a title.  
On the other hand, `##` creates a smaller version of the heading, and `###` creates a smaller version of the sub-heading.<br/>

&nbsp;

Examples of all 3:
# Heading  
## Sub-heading  
### Sub-sub-heading

&nbsp;

## Text formatting
Text can be formatted into a URL (uniform resource locator); turned into bold and italic text; the possibilities are endless!  
Specifically, I'll cover how to do bold and italic text this time around.

Bold text is done like so; `**Text**`  
Italics, on the other hand, are done like this; `_Text_`

&nbsp;

Examples of both:  
**Bold!**  
_Italic!_
