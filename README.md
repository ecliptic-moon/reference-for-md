## Headings, sub-headings and sub-sub-headings
The `#` symbol creates a larger heading to work with, this could be used for a title.  
On the other hand, `##` creates a smaller version of the heading, and `###` creates a smaller version of the sub-heading.<br/>

&nbsp;

Examples of all 3:
# Heading
## Sub-heading  
### Sub-sub-heading

&nbsp;

## Text formatting
Text can be formatted into a URL (uniform resource locator); turned into bold and italic text; the possibilities are endless!  
Specifically, I'll cover how to do bold and italic text this time around.

Bold text is done like so; `**Text**`  
Italics, on the other hand, are done like this; `_Text_`

&nbsp;

Examples of both:  
**Bold!**  
_Italic!_

&nbsp;

## Text formatting (2)
In this instance of text formatting, I'll cover how to turn text into a URL (The meaning of URL has been stated above).

To do this, you follow this simple syntax; `[Text](https://link)`

&nbsp;

Example:  
[GitHub!](https://github.com)

&nbsp;

## Putting code examples into your extended descriptions
To do this, simply wrap backticks (\`) around the text you want to codify.  
Example: \`test\` -> `test`.

In order to create a bigger codeblock for larger code examples, do the following:
\`\`\`
TEXT
\`\`\`

The above should output the following:
```
TEXT
```
